# CS_week41-git

This project consist of a website creation in order to control a microcontroller via WebSockets.
We needed 2 outputs and 1 inputs. 

Here is the list of the element you need to do the same as me :
- esp8266
- DC motor
- 2 kohm resistor
- 4.7 kohm resistor
- 100 ohm resistor
- led
- 1 nF condensator
- 2N2222 NPN transistor
- DS18B20 (thermometer)

My ESP8266 allow the control of the motor and the led, and read the data from the thermometer.

Please see the picture of the circuit: <br>

For my site I wanted something simple so that what I have imagined: <br>
